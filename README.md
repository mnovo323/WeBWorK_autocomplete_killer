# WeBWorK Autocompletion Killer
This extension/script was born out of necessity. Webwork is really annoying to use due to the autcompletion on the inputs. This extension stops that. Check the folders for extensions for your browser. It should be up on the chrome web store soon, feel free to port this to whatever browser you're using.
